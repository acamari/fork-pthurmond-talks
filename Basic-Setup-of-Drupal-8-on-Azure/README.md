# Related Files
I have added related scripts and files to this repository under the "scripts-and-files" directory. In it, you will find my solution, the Docksal configuration I used, the htaccess files I configured, the scripts I created for Azure, and even the README documentation I left for the hand-off to the next set of developers.
